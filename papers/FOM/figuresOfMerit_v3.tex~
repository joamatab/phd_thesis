\section{Introduction}

Silicon photonics technology is becoming more and more competitive with respect to other alternative platforms, being its suitability for electronics integration and cost-efficiency the most appealing features. Implementing nonlinear functions in silicon photonics, e.g. switching or routing, has attracted significant interest since they allow, for example, to boost the switching speed compared to electrically-controlled switched. Many different nonlinear devices have been reported in the last years, such as all-optical modulators,~\cite{Almeida2004a} wavelength converters,~\cite{Lee2009} and parametric amplifiers~\cite{Kuyken2011a}. Moreover, all of them may be easily integrated to generate more complex devices within a small area thanks to the high refractive index of silicon.


The main drawback of silicon for realizing nonlinear functionalities at telecom wavelength (around 1550~nm) is two-photon absorption (TPA) effect, not only because of the lost photons in the process but also because the generated carriers subsequently produce undesired free carrier absorption (FCA) and dispersion (FCD). As the Kerr response of the device is determined by $Re\{\gamma\}$ and TPA is given by $Im\{\gamma\}$, a TPA figure-of-merit (FOM) can be defined as $Re\{\gamma\}/(4\pi |Im\{\gamma\}|)$  \cite{Mizrahi1989}. The latter provides an useful dimensionless measurement of the suitability of the material for nonlinear switching, where it is usually considered as suitable if this number is greater than two. This is the reason why a material different from crystalline silicon is needed.  Amorphous silicon (a-Si) has been demonstrated to have a high nonlinear coefficient \cite{Narayanan2010} and low TPA thanks to its wider band-gap \cite{OLeary1997}. Furthermore, it is a material that can be easily 
grown in CMOS compatible processes. As a-Si does not need high annealing temperatures, it is a good candidate for all-optical interconnects in between different chips and it could be grown on a top layer not affecting circuits already integrated on the chip.



On the other hand, a-Si does not always have the same optical properties, as its composition (\emph{i.e.} hydrogen content) or atomic arrangement can vary depending on the fabrication conditions. In Ref.~\cite{Narayanan2010} a $Re\{\gamma\} \simeq 2000~(\mathrm{W}\cdot\mathrm{m})^{-1}$ nonlinear coefficient was presented, but TPA was also high, leading to a figure of merit of 0.66. However, in Ref. \cite{Kuyken2011}, a FOM larger than two was reported. In that work, a degradation of the material within minutes of light exposure was also reported. Here, we report the characterization of the real and imaginary parts of $\gamma$ of a-Si samples with a FOM of 4.9 and no observed material degradation.


\section{Fabrication}
Starting with bulk wafers oxidized with 3~$\mu \mathrm{m}$ thickness, a hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer of 253~nm was deposited by Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 350~\textcelsius. Waveguides were patterned using DUV lithography and HBr Reactive-ion etching, then covered with 1.5~$\mu \mathrm{m}$ m thick silica. Waveguides of 475~nm width and 20~mm length were fabricated and light was coupled horizontally using lensed fibers.

On the other hand, SOI waveguides were also fabricated for comparison. These were processed from SOI wafers with 220~nm Si thickness, patterned with deep-UV lithography and covered with silica after the etching process. Their dimensions were  445$\times$220~nm  for transverse-electric (TE) polarization and 485$\times$220~nm for transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization. Total length was 25~mm and light was coupled through grating couplers.

Figure \ref{fig:sem} shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the facets. Propagation and coupling loss were measured by characterizing waveguides of different lengths (results are shown in Table \ref{table:results}). 


%Then using DUV lithography and HBr RIE etching waveguides were formed and covered with $1.5\mu m$ thick silica.

\section{Four-wave-mixing: Re\{$ \gamma $\}}
Two continuous wave (cw) lasers were coupled to the waveguides, a pump beam with power $P_P(0)$ and a weaker signal beam with power $P_S(0)$, generating an idler signal at the waveguide output $P_i(L)$. We measured the conversion efficiency as a function of the wavelength separation between pump and signal by using an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fwmOSA}. Assuming that at these power levels (below 15~dBm) TPA is negligible, we can use Eq. \ref{eq:FWM} as in Ref.~\cite{Vallaitis2009}.

%(Fig.~\ref{fig:fwmSetup}

%\begin{equation}
%       \eta ^2=\frac{\alpha_0^2}{\alpha_0^2+\Delta \beta^2}\left[ 1+ 4e^{-\alpha_0L}\frac{sin^2(L\Delta\beta/2)}{(1-e^{-\alpha_0L})^2} \right]
%\end{equation}

%where $ \Delta\beta $ for a detuning $ \Delta\lambda = \lambda_p-\lambda_s$ is given by:

%\begin{equation}
%       \Delta \beta=\frac{2\pi cD_2}{\lambda_p^2}\Delta\lambda^2
%\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
        P_i(L)=e^{-\alpha_0L}(\eta Re\{\gamma\}P_P(0)L_{eff})^2 P_s(0)
\label{eq:FWM}
\end{equation}


where $\alpha_0$ is the propagation loss, $L$ the waveguide total length, and $ L_{eff} $ the effective length, defined as $[ 1-\mathrm{exp}(-\alpha L)] / \alpha $

%where $\alpha_0$ is the propagation loss, $L$ the waveguide total length, and $ L_{eff} $ the effective waveguide length, which is defined as:
%\begin{equation}
        %L_{eff}=\frac{1-e^{-\alpha_0L}}{\alpha_0}
%\end{equation}

Finally, the conversion efficiency $\eta$ is given by \cite{Kung2003,Systems2004}:

\begin{equation}
        \eta ^2=\frac{\alpha_0^2}{\alpha_0^2+\Delta \beta^2}\left( 1+ 4e^{-\alpha_0L}\frac{sin^2(L\Delta\beta/2)}{1-e^{-\alpha_0L}} \right)
\end{equation}

where the phase mismatch for a detuning $ \Delta\lambda = \lambda_p-\lambda_s$ is

\begin{equation}
        \Delta \beta=\frac{2\pi cD_\lambda}{\lambda_p^2}\Delta\lambda^2
\end{equation}

where $D_\lambda$ is the chromatic dispersion parameter. One can relate the idler output to the signal output by rearranging Eq.~\ref{eq:FWM} obtaining

\begin{equation}
        \frac{P_i(L)}{P_s(L)}=(\eta Re\{\gamma\}P_P(0)L_{eff})^2 
\label{eq:ratio}
\end{equation}

which is the equation used for the calculation of $Re\{\gamma\}$ and dispersion $D_\lambda$ from the OSA spectra. Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fwmBw} and parameters of the fit are shown in Table~\ref{table:results}. The sign of the dispersion cannot be extracted from this method, but knowing the waveguide geometry, we calculated the dispersion of the waveguides using Finite Elements simulations. We found a good fit with the numeric results shown in Table~\ref{table:results} within a 10\% error, so this gave us the sign of dispersion. Dispersion of the SOI samples was also experimentally characterized with an interferometric setup experimentally obtaining a good agreement too \cite{Mas2012}.

We also show in Fig.~\ref{fig:fwmDifferentPump} the conversion efficiency for different input pump powers, where a slope very close to 2 was observed in all cases, confirming that the parametric conversion depends quadratically on the pump power.

\section{Nonlinear loss measurements: Im\{$ \gamma $\}}
\label{sec:imGamma}
Two-photon absorption is a well-known process in silicon waveguides. In a waveguide, we can consider it as the imaginary part of the gamma coefficient of the waveguide by using this differential equation:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{dP}{dz} = -\alpha_0 P(z) - 2|Im(\gamma)| P(z)^2 
\label{eq:differentialTPA}
\end{equation}

where P is the signal power through the waveguide, $\alpha$ is the linear loss of the waveguide, and $Im(\gamma)$ is the imaginary part of the $\gamma$ coefficient (we use the absolute value because $Im(\gamma)$ is negative, but we want to stress its loss character in the equation with a negative sign). 

The solution of the differential equation shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:differentialTPA} after a distance $L$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
 P(L) = \frac{e^{-\alpha_0 L}}{1+2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_0} P_0
\end{equation}

where $P_0$ is the input power in the waveguide. Therefore the relationship between the transmission at high power ($T_{HP} = P(L)/P_0 $) and the transmission at low power ($T_{LP} = e^{-\alpha_0 L} $) represents only the nonlinear loss $T_{NL}$:

\begin{equation}
 T_{NL}^{-1} = \frac{T_{LP}}{T_{HP}} = 1+2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_0
\label{eq:transmissionLinear}
\end{equation}

which is a linear function on $P_0$. The slope of the curve can give us the two-photon absorption coefficient of our waveguide as in \cite{Vallaitis2009}.
However, this equation is only valid for instantaneous transmission values. When a pulsed signal is sent, and the transmission is averaged over time, the measured transmission would be the integral of the output, which we can define as

%If one sends a pulsed signal, the equation is still correct for every instantaneous moment, but not correct for the overall transmission energy of the pulse.
%If one defines the energy transmission of a pulse $ \tilde{T} $ as the amount read by a power meter, one has to integrate the power along the whole pulse duration:

\begin{equation}
 \tilde{T}  = \frac{\int P(t,L)dt}{\int P_0(t)dt}
\end{equation}

where $\tilde{T}$ represent the averaged transmission of a pulsed signal with an input shape given by $P_0(t)$. With this definition, the ratio with the transmission at low power would be given by:


%\begin{equation}
 %\tilde{T} (L)^{-1} = \frac{\int P_0(t)dt}{\int P(t,L)dt} = \frac{\int P_0(t)dt} {e^{-\alpha L} \int \frac{P_0(t)}{1+2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_0(t)} dt}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\tilde{T}_{NL}^{-1} = \frac{\tilde{T}_{LP}}{\tilde{T}_{HP}} = \frac{\int P_0(t)dt}{\int \frac{P_0(t)}{1+2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_0(t)} dt}
\label{eq:transmissionIntegral}
\end{equation}


which depends on the actual pulse shape $P_{0}(t)$ that is introduced. If the pulsed signal has a rectangular shape, one can use Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionLinear}, but if the shape is different, the integral in Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionIntegral} must be solved, as the result differs significantly. The reason for this variation is the fact that the flanks of the pulse are not affected as hardly by TPA as the peak. Therefore, the overall energy transmission is higher than for the case of cw excitation. For the particular case of a $sech^2$ shape, which corresponds to the output of our laser, the result of  Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionIntegral} is given by:

% One can calculate analytically how much this transmission is for different typical pulse shapes.

%We assume a hyperbolic secant pulse, typical for solitons, which is the shape of our femtosecond fiber laser $  P_0(t) = P_{0 peak}~\mathrm{sech}^2 (\frac{t}{\tau}) $. Solving Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionIntegral} for the hyperbolic secant is not trivial. After some algebraic manipulation and using some properties of inverse hyperbolic trigonometric functions, one can extract the analytical result, which is:<

%\begin{equation}
% P_0(t) = P_{0 peak}~sech^2 \frac{t}{\tau}
%\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
\tilde{T}_{NL}^{-1} = \frac{\tilde{T}_{LP}}{\tilde{T}_{HP}} \bigg|_{sech^2~shape}  = \frac{\sqrt{\delta}\sqrt{\delta + 1}}{\ln(\sqrt{\delta}+\sqrt{\delta+1})} ~~\mathrm{where}~~  \delta = 2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_{0 peak}
\label{eq:transmissionHypSecant}
\end{equation}

%for $ \delta = 2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_{0 peak} $

We measured this parameter with a power meter using a picosecond laser at a wavelength of 1539~nm and a variable attenuator. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:imGammaSamples}, where the curves were fitted to Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionHypSecant} in order to extract the $Im(\gamma)$ parameter shown in Table~\ref{table:results}.

Table~\ref{table:results} show all the numeric results of this work. First, it is worth noting that the TM SOI sample is weakly confined in the vertical direction because the thickness is 220~nm, while confinement of the TM a-Si sample was considerably better, as the thickness was 250~nm. This is the reason why both real and imaginary parts of $\gamma$ are much higher for TE SOI than for the TM SOI. A similar behavior was reported in Ref.~\cite{Vallaitis2009}. The FOM of the TM SOI (0.69) is also higher than the TE SOI (0.43) and higher than bulk silicon FOM (0.32) because the there is more energy going through the silica cladding than for the TE SOI. On the other hand, the TM a-Si sample has a similar $Re\{\gamma\}$ than the TE SOI, but much lower $Im\{\gamma\}$, making the FOM several times higher. The explanation of this, as claimed in the literature \cite{Narayanan2010, Kuyken2011}, is the fact that a-Si has a higher band-gap, which makes TPA lower while keeping a silimar Kerr coefficient. Regarding the 
stability, we did not observe any degradation neither in the FWM conversion efficiency nor any change in the losses when using the pulsed laser at maximum power after one hour of operation, which means that the material is more stable than the one reported in Ref.~\cite{Kuyken2011}, which degraded significantly after few minutes of exposure. The reason for this is probably differences in the fabrication conditions, and this is a topic under investigation but out of the scope of this work.

Finally, the FOM reported in this work is also higher than the one shown in Refs.~\cite{Vallaitis2009,Koos2009} which was based on a hybrid waveguide with a nonlinear organic polymer in a slot configuration, yielding a FOM of 2.19. Amorphous Si is a more suitable material because it is CMOS compatible and less sensitive to temperature variations than organic materials.

\section{Conclusions}
 We report nonlinear characterization of the real and imaginary parts of $\gamma$ of a-Si samples, and a comparison with SOI waveguides. The measured FOM is 4.9, which is more than 7 times higher than for the SOI samples. This material has the additional advantage that it can be grown at the back-end of CMOS line, unlike SOI. These features make a-Si a suitable candidate for nonlinear all-optical switching applications.



%As no annealing was necessary, amorphous Silicon could be used for optical interconnects in between different optical and electrical parts of the chip.

%\section{Conclusion}
%In conclusion, one has to be careful when extracting the imaginary part of $ \gamma $ from pulse transmission measurements, as Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionLinear} is only valid for instantaneous transmission values. If transmission is measured with an averaging power meter, one has to use Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionIntegral} for the specific pulse-shape, where in this paper we provide the solution for Lorentzian, Hyperbolic secant, and Gaussian shapes.

\section{Introduction}
Silicon photonics has recently emerged as a viable technology for integrated photonic devices. Microring resonators are elements which are simple to fabricate and are used for devices such as optical filters,~\cite{BLittle98} sensors,~\cite{KVos07} modulators,~\cite{Almeida04} etc. A high quality factor is usually the key parameter that determines the performance of the device; however, in this technology the factor that limits its highest possible values is in most cases not the propagation loss, which can be below 5db/cm, but the backscattering effect due to sidewall roughness~\cite{Morichetti10}. Backscattering in a resonator cannot be accounted for as loss mechanism, because in a cavity it can grow coherently much faster than the loss. Backscattering is well known effect of splitting the resonances~\cite{BLittle97}; but before splitting them, it can dramatically modify the shape of the resonance. If this effect is not taken into account and one extracts the parameters of the ring from a fit, it can produce a good curve agreement but with very wrong results. In this paper, we propose a characterization technique and a fitting procedure that allows a complete characterization of all the parameters of the ring including backscattering, without the need of a coherent backscattering measuring system as in~\cite{Morichetti10,Morichetti2010}.

\section{Experiment}
Silicon waveguides were fabricated from a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers with 220nm Si thickness and 2$\mu$m buried oxide thickness. Waveguides are fully-etched 220$\times$450nm channels which are covered with a 2$\mu$m $SiO_2$ layer, and grating couplers were used for coupling the light from standard single-mode fibers at $10^o$ angle. Waveguides and gratings were both patterned with deep-UV lithography. Transverse-electric (TE) polarization was used in all the experiments. Transmission spectra were collected with a tunable laser with 1pm resolution with a 2mW input power. The rings had a 20$\mu$m radius and two coupling points, providing a through and a drop port. However, in this experiment we also collect the counter-propagating drop port, which we wil call counter-drop port. Measuring this port is crucial to fully characterize the ring, as it directly provides the information about the backscattering inside the cavity. The gap of the through and drop couplers was 275nm and 300nm respectively. 
\begin{figure}[!t]

    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth,height=4cm]{add_drop_ring_new.eps}
    \caption{Proposed layout for future add-drop rings with drop (D), counter-drop (CD) and through (T) ports.}
    \label{fig:add_drop_ring}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:espectro} shows the experimental result of the transmission through all three ports of one microring. It is worth noting that the shape of the resonances is very variable, even though one would expect the loss and the coupling coefficients to be approximately the same in all cases. The reason from this behavior is the backscattering parameter, which is intrinsically noisy, thus producing an apparently random response in their resonances. The backreflection is noisy because reflections are produced by lateral roughness along the ring, so they are randomly distributed along its length, and the overall reflection coefficient results from the interference of all the components, giving rise to very sharp spectral variations. In order to extract the parameters from this experimental behavior, one must take into account backreflection, otherwise the estimation of the loss and coupling coefficients would depend on which resonance we select, which is unphysical and would produce wrong results. Therefore, a procedure to extract all the parameters including backreflection is needed in order to understand the behavior of our microring resonator. Next section provides an analytical treatment and a recipe to extract all the parameters from any given resonance.


\section{Theory} 
\label{sec:theory}
A method for coupled resonators in the time domain~\cite{Haus84} was used to describe the ring, since it has already been proven to work for ring resonators were the propagating and counter-propagating are coupled through a coupling constant $u$ \cite{Zhang08}.


Following the guidelines in~\cite{Haus84,Zhang08,BLittle97-2} the following expressions for the signal in the different ports shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:add_drop_ring} are easily expressed in terms of quality factors as:
\begin{eqnarray}
	T&=& \left\lVert1-\frac{        \frac{2}{Q_{e,1}}(2j(\omega '-1)+\frac{1}{Q})   }  {   (2j(\omega '-1)+\frac{1}{Q})^2+\frac{1}{Q_u^2}  }\right\rVert^2 \label{eq:T} \\
	D &=& \left\lVert\frac{          \frac{2}{\sqrt{Q_{e,1}Q_{e,2}}}(2j(\omega '-1)+\frac{1}{Q})   }  {   (2j(\omega'-1)+\frac{1}{Q})^2+\frac{1}{Q_u^2}    }\right\rVert^2 \label{eq:D} \\
	CD&=& \left\lVert\frac{          \frac{2}{Q_u\sqrt{Q_{e,1}Q_{e,2}}}   }  {   (2j(\omega'-1)+\frac{1}{Q})^2+\frac{1}{Q_u^2}    }\right\rVert^2 \label{eq:CD}
\end{eqnarray}

where $\omega'$ is the normalized angular frequency of the resonance under study, and the Q-factors are related to the $\tau$ constants of a time-domain analysis through $Q_j=\omega_o \tau_j/2$. The Q values $Q_{e,1}$, $Q_{e,2}$, $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{u}$ correspond respectively to the extrinsic coupling with the bottom and top waveguides, the intrinsic losses and the coupling constant. 

In order to extract the value of the different parameters, a measurement of the through, drop and counter-drop ports is needed. From a measurement of the three ports when $\omega'=1$ ($T_o,D_o,CD_o$) and the full width half maximum ($\delta_{FWHM}$) of the counter-drop port, the 4 parameters that characterize the ring can be deduced. These are: the energy coupling of the bottom waveguide to the ring, $k_1$, the corresponding coupling for the top guide, $k_2$, the intrinsic losses, $\alpha$, and the strength of the coupling in between the two modes. The expressions that result from particularizing equations~\ref{eq:T},\ref{eq:D} and \ref{eq:CD} for $\omega'=1$ and measuring the FWHM of the counter-drop port, are given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
    Q&=&\frac{1}{A} \label{eq:Q} \\
    Q_{e,1}&=&\frac{2A}{(A^2+u^2)(1\pm\sqrt{T_o})}  \label{eq:Qe1}\\
    Q_{e,2}&=&\frac{2A(1\pm\sqrt{T_o})}{D_o(A^2+u^2)}  \label{eq:Qe2}\\
    Q_i^{-1}&=&Q^{-1}-Q_{e1}^{-1}-Q_{e2}^{-1} \label{eq:Qi} \\
    Q_u&=&\frac{1}{u} \label{eq:Qu}
\end{eqnarray}

where:
\begin{eqnarray}
    A&=&\frac{\delta_{FWHM}}{\sqrt{\frac{CD_o}{D_o}-1 + \sqrt{\left(\frac{CD_o}{D_o}\right)^2+1}}}\\
    u&=&\sqrt{\frac{CD_o}{D_o}}A
\end{eqnarray}

where $\delta_{FWHM}$ is normalized.

The sign ambiguity in equations~\ref{eq:Qe1} and \ref{eq:Qe2} is a byproduct of the existence of two degenerate operation regimes in the ring with different parameters but the same resonance shape. This ambiguity is well known in cases without any backreflection effect, and it is usually  overcome by measuring rings with different parameters or looking at the dependence on wavelength as in \cite{McKinnon09}. In our case, the ambiguity only occurs for the peak with lowest reflection coefficient (the peak labeled as (b)), as in the other two cases it would give rise to a negative loss coefficient, which is unphysical. As the sign has to be the same in all the peaks of the same ring, this provides a way to decide the correct sign in the expressions by analysing more than one peak and looking for non-physical solutions.


Using the expressions in \cite{BLittle97-2} and $Q=\omega\tau/2$ the quality factor can be related to the usual energy coupling constants and losses by:
\begin{equation}
    K_j=\frac{\omega_oL}{Q_{e,j} v_g}  \qquad \alpha=\frac{\omega_o}{Q_i v_g} \qquad H_o=\frac{\omega_o}{2Q_uv_g}
\end{equation}


In this expression $v_g$ is the group velocity of the waveguide and can be obtained from the FSR of the ring. Finally, $Q_u$ has been related to the mean backscattered energy per unit length ($H_o$) through the group velocity $v_g$ of the waveguide, because we know from it the mean time that a photon takes to get coupled to the counter-propagating mode, $\tau_u$, and hence, reflected. It has to be remarked that although we are obtaining a distributed parameter, reflections occur at randomly localized points, being this the result of the interference that is responsible for the random nature of the variations of backscattering versus wavelength \cite{stat_backscattering}.




\section{Results}
%The measured spectra at the three ports can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:espectro}. As it is expected from the results in \cite{stat_backscattering}, the extinction ratios and characteristics of the different resonances show a great variability since the backscattering differs from one resonance to the next. This effect can only be observed at high Q-factors due to the increasing relative importance of $Q_u$ with respect to $Q$.

From the experimental data shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:espectro}, we have chosen three consecutive resonances which show quite different behavior in terms of extintion ratio and degree of splitting. The results obtained from the method described in section~\ref{sec:theory} for each resonance are shown in Table I, and the theoretical curves obtained from those parameters are shown in the insets of Fig.~\ref{fig:espectro}, where a good agreement is observed. It is worth noting that the coupling constants and the loss show small variations from resonance to resonance, being the backscattering coefficient the one showing strongest variations. This is expected from the nature of backscattering, and is a demonstration of the validity of our model. The asymmetry of the shape of peaks 1 and 3, which is not reproduced in the theory, could be explained by sudden variations in the reflection coefficient along the width of the resonance, which is not considered in the model.


\section{Conclusion}
We have shown an analytical model and a fitting procedure which allows to extract all the key parameters of a silicon microring resonator with two coupling points. These parameters are both coupling constants, propagation loss and the backscattering coefficient. With this method, we demonstrate that variations of the backscattering parameter are the cause of the strong variations in the shape of different resonances of the same microring. All these parameters can be extracted from simple transmission measurements.

%We think that the methods described in this paper to analyze the parameters from a ring-type resonator when high-Q factors are intended, is an improvement with respect to other methods that don't take into consideration the effects of mutual mode coupling due to backscattering in the ring. Our method also allows for a way to measure the backscattering in waveguides with a standard characterization setup.

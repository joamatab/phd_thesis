\begin{abstract}
We propose a relatively simple experimental setup capable of accurately characterizing the optical phase response of an integrated photonic circuit.
The setup is based on a phase-noise reduction scheme using an external heterodyne Machâ€“Zehnder interferometer.
In particular, we characterize the phase response of different silicon photonic components: undercoupled and overcoupled ring resonators, and a slow light corrugated waveguide.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\noindent In the last years, integrated optics has experimented a remarkable development thanks to technological advances but also because its recent trend towards standardization.
The main advantage of photonic integrated circuits is that one can build a extremely complex systems with hundreds of components on a very small footprint and at a very low cost per device.
The phase response of an element is a key parameter that is required for the design of a system which includes it.
However, measuring the phase response is not straightforward, as under normal circumstances phase noise prevents simple interferometric measurements using for example an external Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI).


\emph{Optical vector network analyzers} (OVNA) are commercial devices sensitive to phase~\cite{Vanwiggeren2003, Gifford2005}.
They employ specific techniques to alleviate phase noise problems in their measurement, requiring complex synchronous receiving schemes with fringe monitoring and very fast laser tuning speeds (usually higher than 100~nm/s).
Fast laser sweeping reduces phase noise, as thermally-induced noise usually has a 1/f-like spectral dependence.


In this work, we present an alternative technique for measuring the phase response of a photonic component using an ordinary laser with a tuning speed below 1~nm/s.
To achieve this, we cancel the phase noise employing a counter-propagating reference beam at fixed wavelength.
In Ref.~\cite{Mas2012} we applied the same concept to characterize chromatic dispersion in waveguides with different geometries.
In this paper we characterize the phase response of different elements which are common building blocks, in particular, a silicon micro-ring resonator and a corrugated waveguide.
In the former, we distinguish undercoupling from overcoupling conditions and extract the parameters of the ring.
In the latter, we plot the group index of the corrugation from a single segment of waveguide without the need of integrated MZIs and fringe spacing calculations.


\section{Experimental setup}
The experimental setup is a fiber-based MZI, where acousto-optic modulators (AOM) act as frequency shifters (Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersionSetup}).
Each branch applies a slightly different frequency shift (40~kHz in our experiment) and the lock-in amplifier measures the 40~kHz beating pattern.
The phase of these beatings with respect to the RF generators provides the phase of the system, but they are affected by thermal phase noise as high as several radians per second. 
This noise would make unfeasible a phase characterization using a laser with few nm/s tuning speed.
To cancel the phase noise, we introduce from the opposite end a reference counter-propagating beam at a fixed wavelength.
This signal produces another beating pattern used as a reference for the lock-in amplifier.
As thermal fluctuations equally affect both beams, they cancel out, measuring only the wavelength-dependent phase variations.

	\label{fig:dispersionSetup}
\end{figure}

To balance the interferometer for different device lengths there is an optical delay line in the branch without sample.
Before each sweep is launched, the MZI must be balanced in order to avoid too steep slopes in the $\omega$ phase dependence.
In addition, it is convenient to set the wavelength of the counter-propagating reference beam, $\omega_0$, approximately in the middle of the sweep in order to minimize the phase noise.
If the building block to characterize is in series with other elements, (couplers, connecting waveguides, tapers, etc.) the measurement requires a reference sample with the same elements, but without the component under test (e.g. the corrugated waveguide). If the sample is entirely homogeneous, for example a straight waveguide, the reference measurement would be the trace with no sample.
The reference sweep provides the system response, which must be subtracted from the measurement with the component under test. 
Mathematically, the phase dependence obtained with the lock-in, after subtracting the system response, becomes:


\begin{equation}
  \phi(\omega)= \beta_c L_c - \beta_{air} \Delta L_{air} =\phi_{c}(\omega)-\frac{\omega\Delta L_{air}}{c}
  \label{eq:response}
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the measured phase, $\phi_{c}$ the phase introduced by the component under test, $\Delta L_{air}$ the extra length introduced in the optical delay line to balance the MZI with respect to the reference measurement, $\beta_c$ and $\beta_{air}$ the propagation constants of the component and of air respectively, and $c$ the speed of light in vacuum.
In Ref.~\cite{Mas2012} we showed that if the component under test has a length $L_{c}$, then the the group index of the component is:

\begin{equation}
  n_{g} = \frac{\Delta L_{air}}{L_{c}}
  \label{eq:group_index_pathBalancing}
\end{equation}

Minimizing the phase versus wavelength slope balances the MZI.
A slope equal to zero at a certain wavelength corresponds to perfect balancing, so one can extract the group index of the component under test.
Finally, from the group index slope variation we extract its wavelength dependence (Section \ref{sec:corrWaveguides}).
It is worth mentioning that the lock-in simultaneously characterizes phase and amplitude in one single sweep.
Moreover, noise due to gradual slight misalignment cancels out normalizing with the amplitude of the reference signal.

\section{Experiment}
Samples were fabricated using the ePIXfab platform, processed from 220~nm Si thickness SOI wafers, patterned with deep-UV lithography and covered with silica after the etching process.
They included 20~$\mu$m radius ring resonators and a corrugated waveguide.
In both cases we coupled transverse-electric (TE) light using grating couplers.

\subsection{Ring resonators parameter extraction}
\label{sec:ringResonators}
Ring resonators are common building blocks, as they can be used as filters, multiplexers, modulators, \emph{etc}~\cite{Bogaerts:12}. Their spectrum consist of a series of resonances, whose separation is called free spectral range (FSR), which is related to the length and group index of the cavity:

\begin{equation}
	FSR (nm)=\frac{\lambda_{res}^2}{n_gL}
	\label{eq:FSRanillo}
\end{equation} 

where $n_g$ is the group index and $L$ is the round trip length.

The transmission equation of a ring can be easily obtained~\cite{McKinnon2009}:

\begin{equation}
	E_{out}/E_{in}=\frac{t-A}{1-tA}
\label{eq:transmissionRing}
\end{equation}

Where $A$ is the single-pass amplitude transmission and the self ($t$) and cross-coupling ($k$) coefficients of the coupler satisfying $k^2+t^2=1$.

Depending on the relation between the coupling coefficient and the losses, a ring resonator can be:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Critically coupled ($t=A$):} The attenuation in one trip through the ring equals the coupling coefficient. In this case there is zero transmission at resonance, because the output light coming from the ring and from the input port cancel out.
 
 \item \textbf{Under-coupled ($k<A,t>A$):}  The coupling coefficient is smaller than the attenuation in a single trip through the ring. Therefore the resonances produce a phase fluctuation.
 
 \item \textbf{Over-coupled ($k>A,t<A$):} The coupling coefficient is higher than the attenuation through the ring. Therefore the phase accumulates an extra $2\pi$ at each resonance because at the output, more energy is coming from the ring than from the input port, generating an extra phase delay.

\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{ringTesis}
    \caption{Calculated transmission and phase spectra of ring resonators under different regimes. Note that it is impossible to distinguish undercoupled from overcoupling regimes just from the transmission spectrum.}
    \label{fig:ringDifferentCoupling}
\end{figure}


The procedure for extracting the parameters of a ring resonator usually starts by measuring the FSR to extract the group index, and then focus on a single resonance to extract the loss and the coupling coefficient from a fit.
However, with this method, the undercoupled and overcoupled regimes are indistinguishable, as swapping the loss and coupling parameters generates exactly the same transmission spectrum.
This problem is addressed in Ref.~\cite{McKinnon2009}, where they propose different strategies to disentangle the parameters by looking at many resonances and how they depend on the wavelength.
However, their approach requires some assumptions and measuring a very wide spectral range.
 
With the setup that we propose in this paper, the phase response is also measured, therefore we only need one resonance to determine all the parameters of the ring.
From the phase spectrum, it is straightforward to distinguish the undercoupled from the overcoupled regime as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ringDifferentCoupling}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:overcoupled} shows measured and fitted transmission and phase spectra of two different ring resonators using our technique.
The only difference between both rings is the gap between the bus and the ring, which is expected to result in a different coupling coefficient, but similar loss and index.
The phase response allowed us to clearly distinguish the regime, thus the parameters can be easily extracted.
The coupling coefficients obtained (0.350 for the 200~nm gap and 0.217 for the 275~nm gap) follow the expected trend, while the absorption and group index coefficients are very similar.
This, together with the good agreement between experiment and fit, allows us to conclude that the technique successfully provided a complete characterization of the component.

\subsection{Slow light corrugated waveguides}
\label{sec:corrWaveguides}
Group index measurements are usually based on fringe separation ~\cite{shang81,vlasov:05,yao:811,Dulkeith2006} and path balancing~\cite{Cohen:82,Knox:88,Liang:98} of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:groupIndex} we show the fringes of an interferometer with a 450~$\mu$m corrugated waveguide in one branch and a reference photonic wire on the other branch.
From the wavelength fringe separation ($ \lambda_{min} - \lambda_{max} $) we obtain the variation of the group index with respect to the photonic wire $ n_{g,ref} $~\cite{vlasov:05}:


\begin{equation}
  n_g (\lambda)=\frac{\lambda_{min} \lambda_{max}}{ 2L (\lambda_{min} - \lambda_{max})} + n_{g,ref}
\label{eq:fringes}
\end{equation}


where $n_{g,ref}$ is the group index of the reference branch, which in our case was obtained from the free spectral range (FSR) of the ring resonators (Eq.~\ref{eq:FSRanillo}).  % $n_{g,ref}=4.36$


On the other hand, our technique provides a continuous phase characterization from which we can extract group index with high resolution only limited by the laser step size. To characterize the sample, an integrated MZI is not necessary. In this case, we measured two corrugated waveguides with different lengths, one being 450~$\mu$m and the other one 27~$\mu$m. The subtraction of their responses cancels the coupling regions and system response, only leaving the response of a corrugated waveguide of 423~$\mu$m length.

To balance the interferometer from the short (27~$\mu$m) to the long waveguide (450~$\mu$m), a 11~ps delay increment was necessary in the optical delay line.
This means that an equivalent $L=423~\mu$m-long corrugated waveguide has a group delay $T_g=11$~ps, which corresponds to a group index $n_g(\omega_0)=7.8$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:group_index_pathBalancing}).
With the interferometer balanced, we extracted the group index variations around $n_g(\omega_0)$ from the phase evolution slope using this equation:

\begin{equation}
  n_g (\omega)=  n_g(\omega_0) + \frac{c}{L} \frac{d\phi}{d\omega}
 \label{eq:groupIndexEvolution}
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:groupIndex} shows a comparison between the group index curve obtained with our technique using Eq.~\ref{eq:groupIndexEvolution}, and the points obtained from the fringes of the MZI applying Eq.~\ref{eq:fringes}. The results agree, but the curve obtained with the heterogeneous technique is more immune to the noise, and has the advantage of being continuous rather than scattered. For these reasons, we believe that our proposed technique is suitable for accurate characterization of slow-light structures.

  \label{fig:groupIndex}
\end{figure}

% In blue dashed line: continuous group index measurement. In green dots, traditional group index measurement using an indirect measurement of the phase with the fringes of a MZI interferometer. Fringes get narrower at the band edges of the corrugated waveguide, known as slow light region, where we observe higher group index ($n_g$).

\section{Conclusion}
We have shown an experimental technique for phase response characterization of integrated photonic components.
The technique cancels out phase noise by using a counter-propagating reference beam, thus avoiding the need of extremely fast tuning rates or cumbersome temperature control schemes.
We characterized a microring resonator and a corrugated waveguide as examples of application.
From the ring resonator phase response, we clearly distinguished overcoupling from undercoupling regimes, observing an excellent agreement with simulations.
In the corrugated waveguide, we measured the group index profile in the slow-light band with less noise than with a traditional fringe-spacing method.

\begin{abstract}
We present the characterization of the nonlinear-dynamics of a CMOS-compatible horizontal-slot waveguide with silicon-nanocrystals, where the temporal behavior of the phase and amplitude of the nonlinear response are simultaneously monitored. Low carriers were generated even for high pump peak pulses. Measurements are complemented with split-step Fourier simulations.

\section{Introduction}

Nonlinear silicon-based photonic devices can introduce key functionalities for on-chip optical signal processing and routing. In the last years, many different nonlinear silicon devices have been reported, such as all-optical modulators~\cite{Almeida2004a}, wavelength converters~\cite{Lee2009}, demultiplexers~\cite{Koos2009}, etc. These nonlinear devices can be based either on free carriers or on the bound-electron Kerr coefficient. In pure silicon waveguides, the Kerr effect is usually hindered by more intense and longer-lasting free-carrier dispersion (FCD). However, it is more desirable to exploit the Kerr effect, as its temporal response is instantaneous (no speed limitation) and it enables parametric conversion and amplification. In order to increase the Kerr coefficent and reduce carrier effects in silicon waveguides, a slot-type geometry was proposed \cite{Sanchis2007}, where a thin layer of another material with high nonlinear coeffcient is sandwiched between two silicon channels. A vertical slot geometry allowed the introduction of an organic polymer and this device showed optical 160Gb/s demultiplexing capabilities~\cite{Koos2009}; however, these materials involve non-CMOS processes and impose strict temperature limitations. On the other hand, silicon-nanocrystal-based horizontal slot waveguides only require CMOS processes, and have recently demonstrated ultrafast all-optical modulation capabilities and good nonlinear properties~\cite{Spano2009, Martinez2010a, Otona, Trita2011}. In this paper, we study the nonlinear ultrafast dynamics of this type of waveguide, where we show that the effect of carriers is greatly reduced as compared to silicon channel waveguides. We also report quantitative measurements of nonlinear absorption of these waveguides. Finally we show simulation results which fit the experimental results and provide estimations of the nonlinear parameters of the waveguides.


%Silicon photonics is a technology that is becoming competitive with alternative technologies in photonics, being its high integrability and low cost the most appealing features. Nonlinear silicon photonics is a very active research line, as devices with all-optical functionality could boost their speed with respect to their electrically-controlled counterpart. Many different nonlinear devices have been reported in the last years, such as all-optical modulators,~\cite{Almeida2004a} wavelength converters,~\cite{Lee2009} etc. When carrier effects are involved in these devices, the speed is limited by the carrier recombination time, which is usually in the order of 1ns. Although carrier sweeping can improve the speed,~\cite{Turner-Foster2010} nonlinear devices based on bound-electron Kerr effect are preferred, as their bandwidth does not have this limitation. Slot waveguides have demonstrated to increase the Kerr effect because of the field enhancement produced in the low-index section. Different materials have been used to fill the slot, such as organic polymers, which have allowed to demonstrate all-optical 160Gb/s demultiplexing,~\cite{Koos2009} but these materials involve non-CMOS processes and impose temperature limitations. Silicon-nanocrystal-based waveguides are fully CMOS-compatible and have a very high nonlinear coefficient,~\cite{Spano2009} and ultrafast all-optical modulation and logic gates have been recently demonstrated \cite{Martinez2010a}-\cite{Otona}. In this paper we study the nonlinear dynamics of this kind of waveguides with a time-resolved technique. Measurements are also complemented wit split-step Fourier simulations.

\section{Fabrication}
Samples were fabricated starting from silicon‑-on‑-insulator (SOI) wafers with 220nm Si thickness. On top of the Si layer, a 100nm--thick layer of silicon--rich silica ($ SiO_x $) was grown by PECVD, and annealed at 1000$^o$C in $ N_2 $ ambient for 210s. The amount of silicon excess was 16\% and Silicon-nanocrystals had an an average size of 4nm . On top of that layer, a 240nm-thick layer of amorphous $ Si $ was grown by Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) to form the top half of the waveguide. Waveguides were patterned with deep-UV lithography and etched down to the buried oxide to form channels as the ones reported in \cite{Martinez2010a, Trita2011}. The whole layout was covered with silica after the etching process. On the other hand, Si strip waveguides were also fabricated for comparison. These were also processed from SOI wafers patterned wtih deep-UV lithography, and their dimensions were 445x220 for TE polarization and 485x220 for TM polarization. TE waveguide was 10mm long and TM 25mm.

%Samples had the same fabrication as the one in paper \cite{Trita2011}, manufactured during the European project PHOLOGIC.

\section{Characterization}
The waveguides characterized in this paper are 7mm long, where we excite the transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization mode in order to magnify the electric field in the slot. We characterize the samples with a time-resolved phase-sensitive technique similar to the one described in \cite{Vallaitis2008}. In this technique, we divide a 1ps laser pulse into three pulses, one of them intense (pump) and two identical weak ones (a reference and a probe). Then we combine the pump very close to the probe, changing their delay with a variable delay line. Finally the amplitude and phase of the probe is monitored as a function this delay by using a lock--in amplifier.

\section{Time-resolved measurements}
In Fig. \ref{fig:timeResolvesMeasurements} we observe both Kerr and carriers effect in the TM-horizontal slot compared to TM and TE strip waveguides. They produce opposite phase shifts because Kerr produces an increase in refractive index ($ \Delta n > 0 $) and carriers decrease it ($ \Delta n < 0 $).  The dynamics of each of these processes is also very different. During the pump pulse, an instantaneous phase change is due to Kerr effect, together with an amplitude decrease. This decrease is due to cross-absorption modulation (XAM), which consists of a two-photon absorption (TPA) process where one of the photons comes from the pump and the other comes from the probe. Once the pump pulse is gone, there is a phase response with opposite sign that remains for all the measurement range. This is due to the carrier plasma effect, also known as free-carrier dispersion (FCD). 



%In Fig. \ref{fig:timeResolvesMeasurements} one can observe both Kerr and carriers effect in a regular TM strip waveguide compared to our slot waveguide for similar values of peak power in waveguide. They produce opposite phase shifts because Kerr produces an increase in refractive index ($ \Delta n > 0 $) and carriers decrease it ($ \Delta n < 0 $).  The dynamics of each of these processes is also very different. During the pump pulse, we can see an instantaneous phase change due to Kerr effect, together with an amplitude decrease. This decrease is due to cross-absorption modulation (XAM), which consists of a two-photon absorption (TPA) process where one of the photons comes from the pump and the other comes from the probe. Once the pump pulse is gone, there is a phase response with opposite sign that remains for all the measurement range. This is due to the carrier plasma effect, also known as free-carrier dispersion (FCD). 

%It is worth noting that a phase shift higher than $\pi/2$ is achieved with the highest pump pulse.
The power penalty due to XAM cannot be determined at high peak powers because the abrupt phase changes create a frequency shift in the probe signal modifying the signal detected in the lock-in amplifier. This artifact was also reported in \cite{Vallaitis2009}, so in order to get a more reliable measurement of TPA we performed transmission experiments, which are reported in section~\ref{sec:imGamma}.
%  was  is an artifact of the measurement system, so in order to obtain the TPA we measured losses for different peak powers (See section~\ref{sec:imGamma}). 

%One can calculate the figure of merit (FOM) by using the analysis in Ref. \cite{Vallaitis2009}, for which no estimations of effective area or even peak power are needed. Using the same procedure, we obtained a FOM value of 1,  which is a factor of 2 and 4 higher than TM and TE strip waveguides. 

%In order to compare this result, we also measured a pure silicon sample of dimensions 220x500~nm, and the FOM was 0.1,.



%However, there is also a power penalty due to XAM. In order to quantify the balance between XAM and Kerr effect, one can calculate the figure of merit (FOM) by using the analysis in Ref. \cite{Vallaitis2009}, for which no estimations of effective area or even peak power are needed. Using the same procedure, we obtained a FOM value of 0.4. 
%In order to compare this result, we also measured a pure silicon sample of dimensions 220x500~nm, and the FOM was 0.1, which is a factor of 4 lower.

\section{Time-resolved simulations}
We use an adapted version of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation to simulate the propagation of pump and probe pulses in optical waveguides \cite{Agrawal2001a}. Solving the equation with the symmetrized split-step Fourier method as in \cite{Lin2007} we cross-check simulations with experimental measurements in Figure~\ref{fig:timeResolvesSimulations}. The output of the simulation is the envelope of the pump, probe and reference pulses, so in order to extract the output of the lock-in amplifier we calculated the overlap integral of the probe and reference pulses:



%we need to combine the last two of them to simulate the value that would be read off the lock-in amplifier. We did this by calculating an overlap integral of probe and reference pulses normalized to the power of the reference pulse. The amplitude (phase) of the integral was used as a measure of the transmission (relative phase) that a lock-in amplifier would output.

%This allow us to make efficient and precise simulations of the propagation 


%and to use the fitting values as a cross-check for the results obtained through other methods. 


%An adapted version of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation to simulate the simultaneous propagation of pump and probe pulses in optical waveguides \cite{Agrawal2001a} was used. The equation was solved using the symmetrized split-step Fourier method as described in \cite{Lin2007}. The latter allowed us to make efficient and precise simulations of the propagation and to use the fitting values as a cross-check for the results obtained through other methods. Since the output of the simulator is the envelope of the pump, probe and reference pulses we need to somehow combine the last two of them to simulate the value that would be read off the lock-in amplifier.

\section{Nonlinear loss measurements: Im\{$ \gamma $\}}
\label{sec:imGamma}
Two-photon absorption is a well-known process in silicon waveguides. In a waveguide, we can consider it as the imaginary part of the gamma coefficient of the waveguide by using this differential equation:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{dP}{dz} = -\alpha P(z) - 2|Im(\gamma)| P(z)^2 
\label{eq:differentialTPA}
\end{equation}

where P is the signal power through the waveguide, $\alpha$ is the linear loss of the waveguide, and $Im(\gamma)$ is the imaginary part of the $\gamma$ coefficient (we use the absolute value because $Im(\gamma)$ is negative, but we want to stress its loss character in the equation with a negative sign. The output after a distance $L$ is given by:~\cite{Vallaitis2009}

\begin{equation}
 P(L) = \frac{e^{-\alpha L}}{1+2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_0} P_0
\end{equation}

where $P_0$ is the input power in the waveguide and  $ L_{eff}$ the effective length, defined as $[ 1-\mathrm{exp}(-\alpha L)] / \alpha $


%$ L_{eff} = \frac{1-e^{-\alpha_0L}}{\alpha_0} $


%\begin{equation}
 %L_{eff} = \frac{1-e^{-\alpha_0L}}{\alpha_0}
%\end{equation}

%This means that the inverse of the transmission is:

%\begin{equation}
 %T^{-1} = \frac{P_0}{P(L)} = \frac{1+2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_0}{e^{-\alpha L}}
%\end{equation}

Therefore the relationship between the transmission at high power vs. the transmission at low power ($T_{LP}$) is:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{T^{-1}}{T_{LP}^{-1}} = 1+2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_0
\label{eq:transmissionLinear}
\end{equation}

Which is a linear function on $P_0$. The slope of the curve can give us the two-photon absorption coefficient of our waveguide as in \cite{Vallaitis2009}.
However, this equation is only valid for instantaneous transmission values. When a pulsed signal is sent, and the transmission is averaged over time, the measured transmission would be the integral of the output, which we can define as

%If one sends a pulsed signal, the equation is still correct for every instantaneous moment, but not correct for the overall transmission energy of the pulse.
%If one defines the energy transmission of a pulse $ \tilde{T} $ as the amount read by a power meter, one has to integrate the power along the whole pulse duration:

\begin{equation}
 \tilde{T} (L) = \frac{\int P(t,L)dt}{\int P_0(t)dt}
\end{equation}

were $\tilde{T}$ represent the averaged transmission of a pulsed signal with a shape given by $P(t)$. With this definition, the ratio with the transmission at low power would be give by:


%\begin{equation}
 %\tilde{T} (L)^{-1} = \frac{\int P_0(t)dt}{\int P(t,L)dt} = \frac{\int P_0(t)dt} {e^{-\alpha L} \int \frac{P_0(t)}{1+2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_0(t)} dt}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\tilde{T} (L)^{-1}}{\tilde{T}_{LP} (L)^{-1}} = \frac{\int P_0(t)dt}{\int \frac{P_0(t)}{1+2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_0(t)} dt}
\label{eq:transmissionIntegral}
\end{equation}


which depends on the actual pulse shape $P_{0}(t)$ that is introduced. If the pulsed signal has a rectangular shape, one can use Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionLinear}, but if the shape is different, the integral in Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionIntegral} must be solved, as the result is different. Physically, the reason for this variation is the fact that the flanks of the pulse are not affected as hardly by TPA as the peak. Therefore, the overall energy transmission is higher than for the case of cw excitation. For the particular case of a $sech^2$ shape, which corresponds to the output of our laser, the result of  Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionIntegral} is given by:

% One can calculate analytically how much this transmission is for different typical pulse shapes.

%We assume a hyperbolic secant pulse, typical for solitons, which is the shape of our femtosecond fiber laser $  P_0(t) = P_{0 peak}~\mathrm{sech}^2 (\frac{t}{\tau}) $. Solving Eq.~\ref{eq:transmissionIntegral} for the hyperbolic secant is not trivial. After some algebraic manipulation and using some properties of inverse hyperbolic trigonometric functions, one can extract the analytical result, which is:

%\begin{equation}
% P_0(t) = P_{0 peak}~sech^2 \frac{t}{\tau}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\tilde{T} (L)^{-1}}{\tilde{T}_{LP} (L)^{-1}} \bigg|_{sech^2~shape}  = \frac{\sqrt{\delta}\sqrt{\delta + 1}}{sinh^{-1}(\sqrt{\delta})} ~~\mathrm{where}~~  \delta = 2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_{0 peak}
\label{eq:transmissionHypSecant}
\end{equation}

%for $ \delta = 2|Im(\gamma)| L_{eff} P_{0 peak} $

We measured nonlinear losses with a power meter using the same picosecond laser at a wavelength of 1539~nm, and a variable attenuator.

 %Different peak pulses are obtained using a variable attenuator. Average to peak power conversion factor is 46.85dB, considering 50ns pulse repetition rate (20MHz) and 1-ps hyperbolic-secant pulses. Using an autocorrelator we measure 0.9072ps FWHM. Central wavelength is 1539nm and 2.82nm 3dB-spectral width. Coupling losses are 8dB for the slot and 6dB for TE-TM silicon strip waveguides.

\section{Results and conclusion}
The first significant result is the fact that the slot waveguide has much weaker carrier effect than the Si strip waveguides. This is clear from Fig.~\ref{fig:timeResolvesMeasurements}, and also from the $\sigma_n$ parameter, defined in \cite{Lin2007} and shown in Table~\ref{table:results}. This considerably reduces the undesired patterning effects when modulating a real bit pattern. On the other hand, the figure of merit (FOM) that provides the ratio between Kerr effect and TPA is also significantly higher than the strip waveguides, as shown in Table~\ref{table:results}. All these observations can be explained by the fact that in the slot waveguide, a considerable amount of energy travels through the slot layer, which has much weaker TPA carrier effects. The TM mode of the strip waveguide has a higher FOM than the TE because the TM mode also has more energy in the cladding than the TE mode. These results agree with the ones shown in Ref.~\cite{Vallaitis2009} for a polymer-filled vertical slot; however, our system, being made of inorganic materials and only requiring CMOS processes, are expected to provide more robust and stable devices with less temperature constraints.
In conclusion, ultrafast nonlinear measurements show that silicon-nanocrystal-based horizontal slot waveguides show much weaker carrier effects and higher FOM as compared to Si strip waveguides. This makes the slot structure better suited for CMOS-compatible high-speed all-optical processing than simple Si strip waveguides.


%In conclusion, TM horizontal slot waveguides with silicon nanocrystals could be exploited for nonlinear applications thanks to their high nonlinear coefficient not being hindered by the free-carrier limitations. When carrier effects are involved, the speed in optical devices is limited by their recombination time, which is usually in the order of 1\,ns. However with the time resolved measurements we have observed half free-carrier-absorption (FCA) and an order of magnitude lower free-carrier-dispersion (FCD) thanks to the geometry of the slot waveguide. This could be exploited for high speed optical devices with the advantage of being CMOS-compatible.

%Low carrier generation could solve the problems such as . Optical devices
%The nonlinear behavior of this structure filled with silicon nanocrystals is as high as TE strip waveguides, with a nonlinear absorption similar to TM waveguides.
